# Bootcamp Data Analysis & Technical Exercises üöÄ

## Overview

This repository showcases a collection of weekly data analysis and technical exercises completed during a comprehensive data science bootcamp. It demonstrates the learning journey and practical application of various industry-standard tools and technologies, including Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Azure.

Each week focused on specific areas, building a strong foundation in data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and cloud computing. This repository serves as a portfolio piece highlighting the skills acquired throughout the bootcamp.

## Weekly Breakdown & Key Highlights

### üóìÔ∏è **Week 1: Excel Fundamentals & Data Protection**

* **Day 1: Data Protection Laws**: Understanding the legal landscape of data handling, including the Data Protection Act (DPA), GDPR, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and Computer Misuse Act. Emphasized the importance of compliance, potential consequences of breaches, and best practices for secure and ethical data management.
* **Day 2: Excel Data Analysis**: Practicing fundamental Excel functions for data manipulation, including converting data to tables, filtering, sorting, and using `SUM` and `AVERAGE` functions for basic calculations.
* **Day 3: Pivot Tables & Data Categorization**: Leveraging Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze data, identify key trends (e.g., bike sales by region and demographics), and categorize data using the `SWITCH` function for insightful reporting.
* **Day 4: Presentation Preparation**: Developing strategies for presenting data-driven insights to stakeholders, focusing on effective communication, data storytelling, and the appropriate use of visualization tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.

### üìä **Week 2: Tableau and Power BI for Data Visualization**

* **Day 1: Tableau Overview**: Comparing different Tableau versions (Desktop, Server/Cloud, Public) and understanding their features, limitations, and use cases. Initial exploration of creating visualizations in Tableau (EMSI Job Change Dashboard).
* **Day 2: Data Analysis**: Conducting in-depth data analysis using Tableau and Power BI, extracting key findings and implications from diverse datasets like Spotify trends and global health data. Focused on identifying correlations, trends, and actionable recommendations.
* **Day 3-4: Power BI Labs**: Hands-on experience with Power BI Desktop, covering the end-to-end workflow of data import, transformation using Power Query, report design with various visuals, and the creation of interactive dashboards.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Week 3: SQL for Database Management**

* **Database Design & SQL Fundamentals**: Designing a relational database schema to meet business needs (inventory, sales, customers, employees). Writing SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements with appropriate data types and constraints.
* **Data Relationships & Automation**: Establishing relationships between tables using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints. Implementing SQL triggers to automate tasks like updating stock levels after a sale (`UpdateStockAfterSale`) and managing customer loyalty points (`UpdateLoyaltyPoints`).
* **Data Manipulation & Security**: Inserting initial data into tables using `INSERT INTO` statements. Understanding the importance of database maintenance (backups, data quality checks) and implementing role-based access control for security.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Week 5: Cloud Computing with Azure**

* **Day 1: Understanding Cloud Computing**: Exploring the fundamentals of cloud computing, its real-world applications, different cloud deployment models (Public, Private, Hybrid, Community), and various cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
* **Day 2: Laws & Ethics in IT**: Studying relevant computer-related laws (Computer Misuse Act, Police and Justice Act, Data Protection Act/GDPR) and discussing ethical considerations in IT, including plagiarism, software piracy, and cybersecurity risks.
* **Day 3: Exploring Azure Labs**: Gaining practical experience with Microsoft Azure services, including relational data, non-relational data, and data analytics tools.
* **Day 4: Team Practice & Case Study**: Collaboratively preparing for Azure certification (DP-900) through a practice exam. Analyzing a business case study for "Paws & Whiskers," a pet shop transitioning to Azure cloud, and recommending suitable Azure services and data management strategies while considering legal responsibilities.

### üêç **Week 6: Python for Data Analysis & Practice**

* **Day 2: Python Challenge: FizzBuzz**: Reinforcing fundamental Python programming skills by solving the FizzBuzz challenge, focusing on conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
* **Day 3: Working with Student Data in Pandas**: Utilizing the Pandas library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. Tasks included loading and exploring CSV data, indexing and slicing DataFrames, data manipulation (adding/renaming/dropping columns), aggregation and grouping, advanced operations (pivot tables, adding calculated columns), and exporting data.
* **Day 4: Global Data Practice: GDP Data**: Applying Pandas skills to a real-world GDP dataset, focusing on data loading, basic exploration, and collaborative data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

and notes related to Azure labs and the case study are provided as markdown or text files. Access to an Azure account may be required to replicate the labs.
